After Covid, a lot of companies are moving to a Hybrid work model (partly remote work and partly in the office) - most employees do not have a set desk or office, and there are not enough desks or workstations/cubicles if everyone decided to come to the office. This project aims to create an application (mobile or web) where a company can set up multiple "seat maps'' through which employees can make reservations for specific dates (and seats, if applicable). The application should include different types of seats (e.g. cubicle vs private office) that are available based on various criteria (e.g. employee position, years in the company, etc). Part of this project is to do a Requirements Analysis with an actual workplace, so the actual feature set to be implemented should be derived from this analysis.
